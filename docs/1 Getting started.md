<h1>Getting started</h1>

## Introduction

Firstly, it is important to outline what InfinityFramework is and is not:

InfinityFramework **is not a website builder**.<br>
Nor is it intended to be used by users without any technical background.

InfinityFramework **is not WordPress**.<br>
Nor is it trying to replicate it, although the idea is similar.

InfinityFramework **is not a full-stack framework such as Nuxt**.<br>
It is more high-level and focused on supporting your own business logic by abstracting the lower layers responsible for mounting routes and delivering assets into the user interface.

Infinityframework **is trying to be a middleground between all of these**. It prepares routes, hosting of static assets, administration and much more for you. However, it is still **a framework**. Therefore it is up to you, the developer, to actually fill it with meaningful business logic, user-interfaces, HTML and so on.

## Use cases for InfinityFramework

Infinityframework is ideal for:

- Small websites requiring dynamic content (such as displaying daily menus in a restaurant)

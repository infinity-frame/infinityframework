<h1>Getting started</h1>

## Introduction

Let's start with first introducing the framework for what it's not as to avoid any confusion, so:

InfinityFramework **is not a website builder**.<br>
Nor is it intended to be used by users without any technical background.

InfinityFramework **is not WordPress**.<br>
Nor is it trying to replicate it, although the idea is similar.

InfinityFramework **is not a full-stack framework such as Nuxt**.<br>
It offers more features and abstracts than these types of frameworks.

Infinityframework **is trying to be a middleground between all of these**. It prepares routes, hosting of static assets, administration and much more for you. However, it is still **a framework**. Therefore it is up to you, the developer, to actually fill it with meaningful business logic, user-interfaces, HTML and so on.

## Use cases for InfinityFramework

Infinityframework is ideal for:

- Small websites requiring dynamic content (such as displaying daily menus in a restaurant)
- Internal websites for presentations (e.g. a departure board at a train station).
